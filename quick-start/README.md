## Problems with Spring

- Huge framework
- Multiple setup and configuration steps
- Multiple build and deploy steps

## How does Spring Boot address the problems?

- Spring Boot is opinionated
  - provides a default set of configuration as a starting point
  - the configurations are still customizable, however they work for most of the cases
- Spring Boot prefers convention over configuration
- Spring Boot applications are stand alone, ready to run
- Spring Boot applications are production-ready
